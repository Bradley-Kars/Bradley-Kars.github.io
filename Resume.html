      <p>Hi, my name’s Bradley and I’ve done everything from helping to build a budding national organization run by students in the hopes of furthering their education; to running the IT department of a commercial construction company. I’ve now returned to furthering my education where I’m a Dean’s list student at Purdue University Global, working toward my Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity with a focus in Game Development. While simultaneously employed as a System Support Specialist Intern to further my understanding of the IT field.</p>

<p>I am most skilled in: <mark>System Support</mark> and <mark>Hardware Diagnostics</mark></p>
